- Add your urls 
~~~bash
git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/your-nam/repo
~~~   
~~~bash
git remote add github https://github.com/your-nam/repo
~~~

~~~bash
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>

## Dangerous Pull and Push Specific Branch bat file
On Specific branch case It might be like this
- pull.bat
```bat
@echo off 
git pull gitlab develop
pause
```
ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** using the `develop` branch for updated content. But you can use the `main` branch for stable contents.

- push.bat
```bat
@echo off 
git push github develop
pause
```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** using the `develop` branch is to not harm the `main` branch and to avoid the unnesary pushes.
